# Rotating Mobius Strip

This project is an educational project to learn OpenGL and demonstrates a 3D rotating Mobius strip. The Mobius strip is a non-orientable surface with only one side and one edge, making it a fascinating object in topology.

To run this project, ensure you have the necessary OpenGL libraries installed and set up in your development environment. Compile the code and execute the program to see the Mobius strip rotating in a 3D space.

```
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
./build/RotatingMobiusStrip
```
